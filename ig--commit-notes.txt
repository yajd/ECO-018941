*what happened

-meeting with dave and bart at bars cube to discuss this stuff on 1/28

*did:


**wip
-Dave is working on drawings
-I couldn't add 22042094 or 22026872 to ECO so emailed Cissy asking for help
-Cissy said I can't add only she can, so I told her what i needed to do
-cissy says no one can add at that point, only options are 1) do rev 7, 2) reject rev6 and submit again...... so i emailed bart asking him what he prefers.
-bart wants rev6 rejection method, cissy was cc'ed so waiting to hear from her, if she doesnt say antyhing by 1/30 noon, i should send email
-so got back and cissy says 3rd option and this is what we'll do"
---For the new ECO, I realized I can avoid making 22004490  rev7 by not adding it correct?
---So to new ECO i'll just add the 2 new part numbers?
---And for 22004490 we'll just do the drawing update on Mon?
-so just waiting for 22004490 drawing update, when dave sends it, send it to cissy, co is on "validating work" till then
-2/5/14 dave sent it today so it looks like cissy is taking care of it
